                    THE CHATHACK PROTOCOL (REVISION 3)
                     
Status of this Memo
    
    This RFC specifies a message and file exchange service protocol for the
    project of Network Programming course in ESIPE and requests discussion and
    suggestions for improvements. Distribution of this memo is limited.
    
Summary

    ChatHack is a protocol used to transfer messages to a group of clients and
    to transfer files and messages privately between two clients. The clients
    will need to be authenticated to use the service. The group exchange will be
    done through a server, while private exchanges will be done directly between
    clients via TCP connection.

Acknowlegements

    The protocol was originally designed by Carayol Arnaud and Duris Etienne
    as part of the Network Programming course.

1. Purpose

    ChatHack is a protocol which aims to transfer files and messages. It is 
    implemented on top of the Internet Transmission Control Protocol (TCP or
    socket). [1] It is used to exchange messages and files between two clients
    and messages between all clients. It is designed to be small and easy to 
    implement, therefore it lacks most of the features of the secured 
    authentification system we can find on usual chat services.
    
    Two modes of transfer are supported: a client-server TCP connexion, where a 
    client may exchange simple messages with the server, which will broadcast it
    to all connected clients and a client-client TCP connexion, where two clients
    may exchange messages and files between them, after asking for a direct
    connection through the server.

2. Overview of the Protocol
    
    Any transfer begins with a request to connect to a server. This server will
    ask for a login and a password to authenticate the client. If the client
    is not recognised by the server, he will be signed up. The login has to be
    unique for each client. If the server grants the request, the connection is
    opened and the client will be able to start sending and receiving group
    messages on the ChatHack.
    
    The client is able to receive and send a message through this connexion.
    Each frame contains a message and will be sent to the server. The server
    will then broadcast it to all connected users. The client will also receive
    all the messages sent by other clients to the server.
    
    A client A may send a request to connect to another client B in order to
    send messages and files privately. This will begin with a request to the
    server. The server will ask the client B if it accepts to make the connexion
    and send the response to the client A. If the response is positive, a TCP-
    based connexion will be open between the two clients and they will be able 
    to communicate between them. Client B may refuse the connection, so the 
    connection between the two clients will not take place.
    
    This last connection will allow, not only to send messages, but to also send
    files.
    
    Errors cause termination of the connection. An error is signaled by a 
    frame with the OpCode between 30 and 39.
    
    This protocol is very restrictive, in order to simplify implementation.

3. Relation to other Protocols

    ChatHack is designed to be implemented on top of the Transmission Control
    Protocol (TCP) which is based on the IP (Internet Protocol) with IPV4 or 
    IPV6 to send and receive segments of variable-length with source and 
    destination. Since socket is implemented on the Internet Protocol, frames 
    will have an Internet header, a Control header, a SocketChannel for the 
    connection and a ChatHack header. So ChatHack uses the TCP protocol on its 
    connection part with an IPV4 or IPV6 address and a Port in order to be 
    assigned a connection.

4. Initial Connection Protocol

    An initial connection is established when a client sends a request to the
    server with its username and/or a password. The server responds to the client
    if the username and/or passwords are OK. 
    
    Users that have already given an alias and password should be known by the
    server so that their alias cannot be taken or used without its associated
    password, that is to say, giving an alias and a password for the first time
    means that the user is signed up to the ChatHack.
    
    Users that are only logged in without giving a password can choose an alias 
    that is not already taken by an already signed up / logged in user.
    
    As an example, the following steps show how a client can connect to the
    global chat via ChatHack protocol :
    
        1. Client A wants to connect and sends a connexion request to the
        server, including its alias/ID and password.
        
        2. The server acknowledges the connexion request and sends a login
        request to the Client A.
        
        3. Client A acknowledges the login request and sends a login with or
        without an associated password.
        
        4. Server acknowledges the login with or without password.

    The following steps show how a client can connect to another client in order
    to exchange messages or files privately :
    
        1. Client A sends a private connexion to Client B request to the server.
        
        2. The server transfers the request to Client B.
        
        3. Client B acknowledges the connection request to the server, if it
        refuses the server will return the negative response to Client A.
        
        4. If Client B accepts the private connection request it sends a
        response to the server with its address, port and the Client A's login.
        
        5. The server redirects this frame to Client A and Client A sends to
        the server a frame with its address and Client B's login.
        
        6. The server redirects this frame to Client B.
        
        7. Client A and Client B have each other's addresses and may open the
        private and direct connection.
        
         Client A                      Server                       Client B
            |                             |                             |
            | Can I connect to client B   |                             |
            | with my address and port    |                             |
            |---------------------------->|                             |
            |                             | Can I connect to client B   |

            |                             |                             |
            |                             |   Ok / KO                   |
            |                             |<----------------------------|
            |                                                           |

            |                                                           |
            
    4.1. Client disconnection
    
    The disconnection is asked by the client and it can be triggered by several
    reasons.
    
    The first one, the client can send a frame to disconnect itself from 
    ChatHack or from another client. The server or the other client will then
    return a positive response.
    
            Client                      Server/Client
                |                             |
                | I want to disconnect        |
                |---------------------------->|
                |                             |
                |     OK or KO response       |

5. ChatHack Protocol Frames

    ChatHack protocol supports four types of frames, all of them have been
    mentioned above:
    
        Opcode      Operation
        00 - 09     Connection request(CRQ)
        10 - 19     Acknowledgement (ACK)
        20 - 29     Message / file (DATA)
        30 - 39     Error (ERROR)
        
    Opcode is a unique identifier for each type of frame. Since there are
    several frames for each case, we assign a range of codes for each type of
    frame.
    
    The list of frames described below are the following :
        
        Name of frame                       Direction
        Login                               client->server
        Login with Password                 client->server
        Response for login                  server->client
        Response for login and password     server->client
        Group message                       client->server
        Group message broadcast             server->client
        Request for private connection      clientA->server
        Request for private connection      server->clientB
        Response for private connection     clientB->server
        Response for private connection     server->clientA
        Request for logout                  client->server
        Response for logout                 server->client
        Private message/file                clientA->clientB/clientB->clientA
        
    The ChatHack protocol header of a frame contains the OpCode associated with
    the frame.

                        Figure 5-1 : Login frame
                        
    Login frames have the format shown in Figure 5-1. The opcode associated to
    this type of login frame is 00, 03 and 04. The login, corresponding to the 
    alias chosen by the client, must be encoded in UTF_8. The presentation frame
    04 aims to identify who we are talking to.
    
              byte       int       String        int        String
           ------------------------------------------------------------
           | Opcode | SizeOfLogin | Login | SizeOfPassword | Password |
           ------------------------------------------------------------
                     Figure 5-2 : Login with password frame
    
    Login with password frames have the format shown in Figure 5-2. The opcode
    associated to this type of login is 01. The login and password are encoded
    in UTF_8.
    
    The Login frames are used as Request for Connection to the server.
    
5.1.2. ChatHack Request for Private Connection Frame
                
          byte       int        String   byte(4 or 16)    byte      int
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        | Opcode | SizeOfLogin | Login | SizeOfAddress | Address | Port |
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
                        Figure 5-3 : Login frame
                        
    Login frames have the format shown in Figure 5-3. The OpCode associated to
    this type of request is 02 and the field Login corresponds to the alias of
    the user to whom the client wants to be directly connected.
    
    This same frame is used by the server to transmit the request to the client
    to whom the first user wants to be connected to.
    
5.1.3. ChatHack Request for Logout
    
    The client can send a disconnect request to the server to be disconnected
    from ChatHack. It has the same format than the Login Frames in Figure 5-1.
    The OpCode for this request is 03. The request for disconnection with another
    client in the case of private connection is done the same way.
    
    The return codes of the request mean:
    
        00. Connection With Login
        01. Connection With Login And Password
        02. Private Connection Between Two Clients
        03. Disconnect Request
        04. Presentation Frame

                ----------------------------------
                Figure 5-4 : Acknowledgment frame
    
    Simple acknowledgment frame that is sent back to the client to accept the
    connection to the global chat. The server may add a response message. The
    OpCodes 10, 11, 12 and 15 are based on this.
        
5.2.2. Private connection response frames

                       byte      int    String
                    ----------------------------

           Figure 5-5 : Private connection response frame
                        
    When a private connection request is accepted by a client, it will send an
    acknowledgment frame to the server as shown in the Figure 5-4. 
    The server will redirect this frame to the requesting client.
    
                         byte      long    
                    --------------------------
                    | Opcode |   idRequest   |
                    --------------------------
           Figure 5-6 : Private connection response frame for opCode 14 and 13
          
    This frame allowed to know the type of the private request connection, then 
    we know with the opCode 13 that the private connection is OK, but if it's 
    the opCode 14 then the private connection will be KO.
    
5.2.3. Disconnection frame 

    The disconnected frame is based on the Figure 5-3. The server answer with a 
    frame with the OpCode 15 for a good disconnection.
    
    The return codes of the Acknowledgment Frames mean:
                
        10. Connection with Log in OK
        11. Connection with Log in and password OK
        12. Connection KO
        13. Private connection request OK
        14. Private connection request KO
        15. Disconnection OK

    associated to this data frame is 22. File name must be encoded in UTF_8.
    The encoding of the data is given by a sequence of bytes.
    
     The return codes of the Data Frames mean:
                
        20. Global Messages Transmission
        21. Private Messages Transmission
        22. Files Transmission
        
5.4. BDD Server Frames
5.4.1 Server frames

                        byte Long  String   String
                        -----------------------------
                        | 1 | id | Login | Password |
                        -----------------------------
    
    This is the frame to be sent to the BDD server in order to validate a pair of
    login and password requested by a newly connected client. The field id is the
    ID of the client known by the ChatHack server.
    
                         byte Long  String 
                        ------------------
                        | 1 | id | Login | 
                        ------------------
                        
    This is the frame to be sent to the BDD server in order to validate a login
    requested by a newly connected client. The field id is the ID of the client 
    known by the ChatHack server.
                        
5.4.2 Server Response Frame

                        byte  Long
                       ------------
                       | 0/1 | id |
                       ------------
    The BDD server sends back a response with the client's ID and a byte 0 or 1
    that tells the server if the pair of login/password is correct (or the login
    was available to use).

6.4. ChatHack Error Frames

                   byte         int          String
                --------------------------------------
                | Opcode | SizeOfErrorMsg | ErrorMsg |
                --------------------------------------
                     Figure 5-8 : ERROR frame
                     
    An ERROR frame (OpCodes [30-39]) has the form described in Figure 5-8. An
    ERROR frame can be the aknowledgment of any other type of frame. The 
    opcode is an integer indicating the nature of the error. The error message 
    is used for human understanding and should be in UTF_8.
    
    The return codes for the errors mean the following :
        30. Login Error
        31. Login with Password Error
        32. Invalid Address
        33. Invalid Port
        34. Disconnection KO

7. Normal Termination

    A termination of the connection is done when a client makes a disconnection 
    request and this request is accepted without any errors. The server then 
    marks the user as disconnected. 

8. Premature Termination

    In the case of the client disconnecting promptly, the server will mark the
    user as disconnected.
    
I. Appendix

Practical examples

1. ChatHack connexion

1.1. Simple Login

    A client wants to connect to the chat with a temporary nickname "Bob". It
    sends a request to the server:
        ---------------------
        | 00 | 6 | "Bob" |
        ---------------------
    The server checks if "Bob" is already taken by a connected
    user. If it is available, the server sends an acceptation response:
        -----------------------------------
        | 10 | 19 | "Welcome to ChatHack" |
        -----------------------------------
    If the nickname is unavailable it sends an error frame:
        ---------------------------------
        | 30 | 17 | "Unavailable Login" |
        ---------------------------------

1.2. Login with Password

    A client wants to connect to the chat with the nickname "Bob" and the
    password "gAn0nD0Rf". It sends a request to the server:
        ------------------------------------
        | 01 | 3 | "Bob" | 9 | "gAn0nD0Rf" |
        ------------------------------------
    If the nickname and the password don't match, the server sends an error
    response:
        -----------------------------------------------
        | 12 | 19 | "The connection is not permitted" |
        -----------------------------------------------

1.3 Private connection between two users

    A user with the nickname "Bob" wants to communicate privately to another
    user "Alice". It sends a request to the server:
        --------------------
        | 02 | 5 | "Alice" |
        --------------------
    If the user "Alice" is online, the server will simply redirect the same
    frame to it.
    The client may respond positively by sending a frame back to the server
    with its IPV4 address 172.168.0.1 and available port 7777.
        -------------------------------------------
        | 13 | 6 | "Bob" | 4 | 172.168.0.1 | 7777 |
        -------------------------------------------
    The server will redirect the same frame to the user "Bob". This user
    will respond sending its IPV4 address 172.168.10.1 and available port 7767.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | 13 | 10 | "Alice" | 16 | 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 | 7767 |
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This last frame will be first received by the server and then redirected to
    the user "Alice" so that both clients get the address and the port to
    be able to create a direct connection between each other.
    
    If the connection is refused by the user "Alice" or it is not connected,
    the server will send a response to the requesting user notifying it:
        ----------------------------------
        | 14 | 18 | "User not connected" |
        ----------------------------------
    If the address cannot be found or recognised by the client, the requesting
    user gets an error response from the server:
        ----------------------------------------
        | 32 | 21 | "client address not valid" |
        ----------------------------------------

2. Disconnected Failed

2.1. Private file exchange

    Two clients, "Bob" and "Alice" are directly connected (see section
    1.3) and want to exchange a file:
        ------------------------------------------
        | 22 | 15 | "MajorasMask.jpg" | 32 | ... |
        ------------------------------------------
    Bob loses his connection and suddenly disconnects.
        ---------------------------------------------------------
        | 34 | 21 | "an error occurred, bob was disconnected. " |
        ---------------------------------------------------------

Security Considerations
    
    Since this version of ChatHack protocol does not include per se any form of
    personal data encryption, passwords and logins are transmitted to the network
    in the clear, which is a huge security breach if used alone. Also, ChatHack
    does not allow suppression of personal data saved by the server (such as
    login and password).
    
    There is no more limitations to file transmission other than needing a known
    format of the file. Binaries and executables may be transferred freely so be
    aware of this when implementing this protocol.
